# Analysis of TED talks
A python script for analysing which topic of TED talk is most popular.<br/>
The dataset is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks">Kaggle (click here).</a><br/>
By this we can observe which topics are the most liked among the audience who watches these talks.<br><br>
The following python modules were used for developing this:
<ul><li><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a></li><br><li><a href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy</a></li><br><li><a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html">Pyplot</a></li><br><ul>
